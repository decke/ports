Drone is a Continuous Delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses
a simple YAML configuration file, a superset of docker-compose, to define and
execute Pipelines inside Docker containers.

The exec runner executes pipelines directly on the host machine. This runner is
intended for workloads that are not suitable for running inside containers. This
requires Drone server 1.2.3 or higher.
