Drone is a Continuous Delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses
a simple YAML configuration file, a superset of docker-compose, to define and
execute Pipelines inside Docker containers.

This package builds the OpenSource Edition of Drone so it does not support any
of the Enterprise Edition features.
