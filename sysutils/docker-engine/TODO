Big steps plan
- start with a new port based on moby (done)
- hack it to get it compile (done)
- runtime testing ("some stuff working")
- cleanup patches / upstreaming

What's working atm:
-running FreeBSD docker containers
-building FreeBSD docker containers (via docker file)
-bridge networking (uses vnet, auto creates a docker0 bridge, assigns IPs and sets up PF nat rule, most likely lot's of validation still needed, IP conflicts etc.)

Most likely lot's of gotcha's as my testing didn't go further than "try if it starts, run some commands, exit"
