Docker requires a bit of setup before usage.

You will need a ZFS dataset mounted on /var/lib/docker

# zfs create -o mountpoint=/var/lib/docker <zroot>/docker

For NAT (and in the future port forwarding) to work you will
need to create the appropiate anchors in your pf.conf:

nat-anchor "docker/*"
rdr-anchor "docker/*"
anchor "docker/*"

The following addition to your rc.conf is also required to make NAT work:

gateway_enable="YES"

Dockerd will automatically enable nat for each bridge managed
by it:

nat on ${iface} from {bridge}:network to any -> (${iface})

Where $iface is the default NIC on the system. This is for 
network connectivity to docker containers in this early port.
This should not be needed in future versions of docker.
