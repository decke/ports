Docker requires a bit of setup before usage.

You will need a ZFS dataset mounted on /var/lib/docker

# zfs create -o mountpoint=/var/lib/docker <zroot>/docker

For NAT (and in the future port forwarding) to work you will
need to create the appropiate anchors in your pf.conf

Dockerd will automatically enable nat for each bridge managed
by it:
nat on ${iface} from {bridge}:network to any -> (${iface})

Where $iface is the default NIC on the system. This is for 
network connectivity to docker containers in this early
port. This should not be needed in future versions of docker.
