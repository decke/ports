Stubby is an application that acts as a local DNS Privacy stub resolver (using
DNS-over-TLS). Stubby encrypts DNS queries sent from a client machine (desktop
or laptop) to a DNS Privacy resolver increasing end user privacy. Stubby is in
the early stages of development but is suitable for technical/advanced users.
