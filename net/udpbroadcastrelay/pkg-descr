This program listens for packets on a specified UDP broadcast port.
When a packet is received, it sends that packet to all specified
interfaces but the one it came from as though it originated from
the original sender.

The primary purpose of this is to allow devices or game servers on
separated local networks (Ethernet, WLAN, VLAN) that use udp
broadcasts to find each other to do so.
